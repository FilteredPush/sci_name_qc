This change derived from a discussion at TDWG 2023 on the use of dwc:taxonID and dwc:scientificNameID. It was concluded that a test VALIDATION_SCIENTIFICNAMEID was justified as CORE while this test should be SUPPLEMENTARY.  The original test ""VALIDATION_TAXONID_AMBIGUOUS"" was seen by the TG2 team as too complex to implement. If we use any single bdq:sourceAuthority such as GBIF, a valid and complete dwc:taxonID based on an alternative source authority is unlikely to provide a valid match. A text or number string as a namespace indicator without a URI will be ambiguous. As an example, GBIF's backbone taxonomy dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.15468/39omei. When referencing a GBIF taxon by GBIF's identifier for that taxon, use the the pseudo-namespace ""gbif:"" and the form ""gbif:{integer}"" as the value for dwc:taxonID.","closed","TG2 Validation NAME CODED Test Supplementary Conformance",,,"recommended","","Validation"
